## Fundamentals of Web Apps"

The "Fundamentals of Web Apps" is an introductory course that covers the principles and concepts of web development. The course provides an example application, 
located at https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp, to demonstrate these concepts. However, it's important to note that the example application showcases outdated 
web development techniques and should not be considered a best practice for modern web applications.

To get started with the course, it is recommended to use the Chrome browser and keep the Developer Console open at all times. The Developer Console can be opened on macOS by 
pressing fn-F12 or option-cmd-i, and on Windows or Linux by pressing Fn-F12 or ctrl-shift-i. This console is a crucial tool for web development and will be used extensively 
throughout the course.

Additionally, it is advised to open the Network tab in the Developer Console and enable the "Disable cache" option. The Network tab allows you to observe the communication 
between the browser and the server, while disabling the cache ensures that you receive up-to-date information. The "Preserve log" option can also be useful as it saves application 
logs when the page is reloaded.

The communication between the server and the browser occurs using the HTTP protocol. When you reload the page, the Network tab in the console displays the communication events. 
For example, it shows that the browser fetched the contents of the page from the server and downloaded an image. The Network tab provides detailed information about these requests 
and responses, including the HTTP method used (GET), the status codes, and various headers.
